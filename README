check.py    - isstring and isidentifier
dot.py      - DotBuilder class to easily create GRaphviz dot sources
environment - Environment, a key/value environment building class
support     - a usage warning decorator and print_stderr
types       - TypedList, NamedTypedOrderedDict and Any
visitor     - an extensive Visitor implementation framework

Enjoy if you find them useful, but remember: YMMV ;-)
